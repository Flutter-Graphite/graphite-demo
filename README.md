# Graphite Demo

A demo project for testing graphite support in a Flutter application.

## Getting Started

The purpose of this project is just to test the Graphite-enabled status of the
custom flutter engine. If you run the app using a Graphite-enabled version of
the flutter engine, the text in the app home page should look like the
following:

![Sample Nastaliq text with graphite enabled](samples/text_with_graphite.png)

If you run the app with the default flutter engine, the text will look like
this:

![Sample Nastaliq text without graphite enabled](samples/text_without_graphite.png)
